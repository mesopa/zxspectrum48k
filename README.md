# ZX Spectrum 48k Website Prototype

This website is dedicated to my childhood first computer, also my father calculation machine. The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now-closed Timex factory. I remember playing with my father roles of printed thermal paper full of numbers and equations. Playing Jetset Willy and waite for long periods of time to load any software. To remember the old and new generation, I created this prototype if ZX Spectrum 48k was launched today. All the present photos were taken by me and the ZX present in this photos is my father Spectrum, that still works today. The only modification was the conversion of the RF to video composite.
